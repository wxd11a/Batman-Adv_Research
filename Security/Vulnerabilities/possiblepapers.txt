Abstract:
	Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) is an emerging technology that has played an important role in the wireless communication scenario. Wireless Mesh Networks are becoming popular as a way of providing Internet access in a cost-effective, easy, and fast manner. However, due to their instrinsic characteristics such as open medium, WMNs are vulnerable to various types of attacks, which aim at disrupting their routing operations. Infected mesh nodes can generate malicious traffic, which puts the other mesh nodes at risk. In this paper, we present a routing manipulation attack against Better Appraoch to Mobile Ad-hoc Network (BATMAN) [(I'm guessing this is BATMAN at layer 3)], a proactive routing protocol designed especially for WMNs. We provide a detailed analysis of the attack and demonstrate its feasibility through a virtualized network environment running BATMAN protocol instances in virtual machines. After, we present a mechanism to detect this kind of attack and identify the source of the attack.

Abstract:
Wireless Mesh Network (WMN) is a recent technology that is gaining significant importance among traditional wireless networks. WMN is considered a suitable solution for providing Internet access in an inexpensive, convenient, and rapid manner. Nonetheless, WMNs are exposed to various types of security threats due to their intrinsic characteristics such as open braodcast medium and decentralized architecture. For instance, a compromised node can generate malicious traffic in order to distrupt the network routing service, putting the entire mesh network at risk. In this paper, we provide an efficient method for detecting active attacks against the routing functionality of network[s]. The approach is based on the analysis of the protocl routing behavior by processing the traces produced by each node using Mont image Monitoring Tool (MMT), which outputs routing events that are correlated between nodes to detect potential intrusions. We demonstrate the approach feasibility by using a virtualized mesh network platform that consists of virtual nodes executing Better Approach to Mobile Ad-hoc Network (BATMAN[-adv]) routing protocol. The experimental results show that the proposed method accurately identifies malicious routing traffic diffused by an attacker through the network.
