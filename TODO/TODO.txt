Trouble-shooting on IBSS and OpenWRT

ASK:
	Talk to Alfa about prioritizing traffic by reducing the contention window based upon the type of traffic.

REMEMBER:
	Regulations regarding municipalities and ISPs

Come up with a good analogy of mesh networks
	- Highways are ISPs and mesh networks are the access roads and communal roads
	- If there is a wreck on the highway then you should be able to exit and return on the highway
	- If you want to go to a neighbor's house you shouldn't have to get on the highway.
