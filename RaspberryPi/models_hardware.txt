Rasberry Pi models
	B/B+
		These would prove the best for our research since they both provide ethernet ports for if we needed wired connections.
		The B+ model would be safer for testing due to some low power issues with the USB connections on the model B.
			People have reported wireless adapters not working due to their usb not being able to provide the needed power.

WiFi notes
	It would be best to stick with the Atheros chip set due to its openess and community support. Prefer to also stay with
		the ath9k series chips as well.

Operating System
	As of 2014/09/11 it looks like Debian or a Debian variant (Raspbian) would be the safest bet. OpenWRT supports models B, but not B+.

	Batman-adv 2014.3.0 supports the Linux kernel versions 2.6.29-3.16.
	

NEEDED:
	Buy a power adapter. (Hao has a 5V microusb adapter)
