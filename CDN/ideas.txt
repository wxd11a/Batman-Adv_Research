1. Major findings of the CDN paper
2. Generalization of CDN to multi-node content network in the last mile
	-> cache memory - size, speed, etc.
	-> cache coordination
		- protocols for that algorithmn
		- how far from the leaf nodes (the consumers)
		- rate of message exchange
	-> impact of routing protocol
		- there positives and negatives to this method. A branch of the network could be responsible for a particular set of data.
		- SECURITY ISSUES 
			- possible solutions
				- public key infrastructure within the mesh network itself. localized key exchange so we know that the node
					is part of the mesh.
	-> layered architecture violations
