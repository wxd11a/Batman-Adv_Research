Dynamic Replica Placement for Scalable Content Delivery - http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-45748-8_29
	Abstrct: In this paper, we propose the dissemination tree, a dynamic content distribution system built on top of a peer-to-peer location
		service. We present a replica placement protocol that builds the tree while meeting QoS and server capacity constraints. The
		number of replicas as well as the delay and bandwidth consumption for update propagatio are significantly reduced. Simulation
		results show that the disseminatio tree has close to the optimal number of replicas, good load distribution, small delay
		and bandwidth penalties for update multicast compared with the ideal case: static replica placement on IP multicast.
