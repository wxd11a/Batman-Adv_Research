"For an I frame, with intra-frame encoding, its image frame consists of blocks converted to a set of coefficients using discrete cosine transform(DCT). A group of blocks form a slice carried within one packet. If th efirst block is damaged, the whole group may be lost, which creates a strip in the image. (Internet Protocol Television (IPTV): The Killer Application for the Next-Generation Internet)"
	- I-frame is a type of video encoding that is the "least compressible but don't require other video frames to decode."
		This is compared to the P-frame and B-frame compression.
	- While an upstream node in a mesh network could still have this problem, if a node closer to the destination drops any frames
		then mesh networking may provide to be a solution.
	- What about mesh networks comprised of CDNs?

"Since 802.11-based multi-hop wireless networks implement Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) for medium access, an end-to-end route may contain several relay nodes contending for the channel resulting [in] degradation of video quality due to increased end-to-end delay and packet probability. All of these problems have prevented the implementation of indoor cabling by 802.11 links until now. (The Convergence Scheme on Network Utility Maximization in Wireless Multicast Networks)"
	- This is simply a listing of part of the current problem.

"To overcome incrased number of packet losses and delay jitter, both of which are especially harmful for video, the authors presented enhanced distributed channel access 802.11 (EDCA) to provide quality of service via different priority traffic classes with different contention window size and arbitration inter-frame space (AIFs) values.(The Convergence Scheme on Network Utility Maximization in Wireless Multicast Networks)"
	- This seems more like a hack which will lead to prioritizing traffic based on the type of traffic. This undermines the notion
		that all traffic types are equal. I don't think doing this at the network level would be best since ultimately it should
		be up to the end user the priority of their traffic.

# About rate controllers in multicast networks
"A rate controller is located at the rout[e] of eveyr router node. The outgoing links of a router is towards its downstream routers. The basic idea of flow control is as follows: Initially, the source sends data including a forward control packet (FCP) to the destinations along hte route. At each router node, it computes an expected incoming data rate according to its local buffer occupancy, and construes a backward control packet (BCP) by filling this expected rate in the BCP. (The Convergence Scheme on Network Utility Maximization in Wireless Multicast Networks)"

# OPSD (Optimal Proportional plus Second-order Differential) control scheme
	- Conclusion: "[Addresses] the problem of slow transient response due to the long feedback time in wireless multicast networks. Delayed
		congestion feedback can cause excessive queue buildup and packet loss at bottleneck links especially in multicast. We proposed a
		novel Optimal Proportional plus Second-order Differential (OPSD) control which has [the] capability to diminish oscillations in
		distributed wireless mesh networks via 802.11. The merit of our distribution algorithms is that they can achieve the optimums
		quickly. As evident from the analyses and simulation results, the proposed control scheme can improve the network performance.
